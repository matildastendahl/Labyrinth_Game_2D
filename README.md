# Labyrinth

## Introduction
My project is a labyrinth game. It generates and draws a labyrinth using PyQt6, and allows the the player to navigate
through it using the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to reach the exit of the labyrinth.


## File and directory structure
- The project includes five files:
1. GenerateLabyrinth: Generatelabyrinth class. Generates the labyrinth with Depth-First search recursive backtracker algorithm.
2. DrawLabyrinthPyQt: Scene class. Draws the labyrinth using PyQt6 and handles the user input using keyPressEvent.
3. Player: Creates the player and keeps track of its position.
4. Cell: Creates the cells of which the labyrinth is concluded of.


## Installation instructions

- The code relies on PyQt6, so you need to have PyQt6 installed to run it.
- If you haven't installed PyQt6, you can install it using the following command: pip install PyQt6.

## User instructions

- To execute the program, run the Python script containing the code.
- The labyrinth will be displayed in a graphical window.
- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the player through the labyrinth.
- When the player reaches the exit of the labyrinth, a message box will appear, asking if you want to play again.
