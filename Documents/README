# Labyrinth

## Checkpoint1

## Current properties
The program creates a window, and draws a labyrinth with the Recursive Backtracker Algorithm. The program also creates a
player as a red dot and a button for solving the labyrinth. I have also implemented a test function to check if the labyrinth
is made correctly.

What properties have you already implemented into your project? What can be done with the program at this point?
You can kind of play the game already, you can move the player with your computer keys to solve the labyrinth, but when
you solve it, an error occurs. There is a button for solving the labyrinth but I have not gotten it to work yet.

## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no)
 Yes
 - How is the program executed?
 The program  first creates a "Labyrinth" named window, in where it then creates a widget. After this the "GenerateLabyrinth"
 file is called, where the labyrinth is generated using the Recursive Backtracker Algorithm. After this the labyrinth, a
 button and a player is drawn with PyQt in the widget.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far?
 No idea really, but many, maybe about 30 hours.
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?
 Not anything specific, but I have realized it is more complicated than expected, so I will probably spend a lot more time than planned.

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems?
 A few yes. I still can not get the button to work correctly to show the way out of the labyrinth. I also have not been
 able to make my labyrinth 3D yet, even thought I have tried.
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?
 I will probably do the easier version and not the medium.
