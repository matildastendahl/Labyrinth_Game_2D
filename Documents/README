# Labyrinth

## Checkpoint1

## Current properties
The program currently creates a window, generates a (half-done) labyrinth and draws the labyrinth.

What properties have you already implemented into your project? What can be done with the program at this point?
Nothing can really be done with the program at this point, it can only be started but you can not play yet.

## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no)
 Yes
 - How is the program executed?
 The program  first creates a "Labyrinth" named window, in where it then creates a widget. After this the "labyrint_generator"
 function is called, where the (half-done) labyrinth is generated using Prim's algorithm. After this the labyrinth is drawn with
 PyQt in the widget.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far?
 About 10 hours.
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?
 Not anything specific, but I have realized it is more complicated than expected, so I will probably spend a lot more time than planned.

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems?
 A few with the PyQt, but I got them fixed.
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?
 I will probably do the easier version and not the medium.
